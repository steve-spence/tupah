I LOVE THIS SHOW OMG!

A1 really outdid themselves with this one. The amount of hype that was generated around this show was insane. The show iteself is 
one of the best animes to ever air. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and invest the time to watch this. You will not 
be dissapointed. I'm normally all over seasonal garbage, but this show changed me. I just want to watch better anime.
