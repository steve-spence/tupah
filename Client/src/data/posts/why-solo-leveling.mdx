# Solo Leveling

This is one of my favorite adaptions of all time. 

A1 really outdid themselves with this one (never said before). The amount of hype that was generated around this show was insane. The show iteself is 
one of the best animes to ever air. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and invest the time to watch this. You will not 
be dissapointed. This is not just seasonal garbage. I'd put this up there with Frieren and Chainsaw Man as one of the best anime series released in the last 
few years. After watching this, other anime's just don't hit the same. 

## Overview

This won't spoil anything. This show started as a manhwa, which is basically korean manga with colors. The world in the manhwa is based in 
South Korea, but a bunch of laws and politics meant that the adaptation had to be relocated to Japan. There are only slight differences between the 
manhwa and the anime, but they are noticeable if you have read it. The show is almost like an isekai, but the main character doesn't die, but he is in a sense reborn. 
Obviously he starts at the bottom of the barrel being the weakest charcter in the show, but the story and world building are very interesting. 
If you enjoy playing games, manhwa often have characters that seem like they are from a game world. They always have a panel that the player (main character) can 
upgrade himself with. There are a lot of good manhwa's out there. I have read a few but I think if I had to reccommend another besides this it would be Legend of the Northern Blade.
