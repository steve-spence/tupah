# Orlando

Orlando I love you, Orlando!
Sea world and Disney and putt putt golfing!

That's from the Book of Mormon play a song called [Two by Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SvANeOFWAU&list=RD3SvANeOFWAU&start_radio=1&ab_channel=AndrewRannells-Topic).
It's a great song! I visited Universal Studios with my family. I would reccommend going once if you've never been. The world they build there is quite charming. Personally, I 
really enjoyed the Harry Potter world. They recreated diagon alley and I bought one of the chocolate frogs from the movie. I'll never eat it!
