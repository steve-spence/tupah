# Welcome

So here I am sitting in my room figuring out what I want to do with my life.

>_Why make a blog? It's not like you're gonna make anything from this._

I know that. I am just writing on this blog because 
 - I want to.
 - I get to build a cool website.
 - I think it'd be fun to have a record of my life.
 - Maybe I can help someone with one of my posts.

 ## What you will probably see me post.

 At this stage, I am thinking about posting about things I find interesting. I have spent a lot of time doing game development, but I've never released a game??? 
 That doesn't really make a whole lotta sense. I am thinking about making a dev log for Witchpaw which is a game I'm making. It's based on raccoons and magic. Pretty 
 terrible description I know, but that makes you want to read about it maybe? (shameless link [Witchpaw](https://tupah.me/projects/witchpaw)) I like doing web development 
 so I will post some tutorials or videos on cool components or libraries that are worth your time to look at. 
 I get obesssed with games, so I will have some posts about games. I play Marvel Rivals, OldSchool RuneScape, Osu, Minecraft... League.
 I've been playing games for as long as I could move a mouse. My opinion is valid at least half the time.
 I also watch a lot of anime, I have some heater takes on a lot of great anime, like which ones are worth your time and which ones are for seasonal anime enjoyers.

 ## Overall

 This might not be the best blog in the world. I am just looking to document my life. I want to be remembered and if this website helps people remember me, my goal is accomplished. 
 And even if no one ever reads this, I am still proud of the work I did. Tag along for the journey if you are interested, you might just learn a thing or two.
