# Getting Started wtih Python

So here I am sitting in my room figuring out what I want to do with my life.

>_"Why make a blog? It's not like you're gonna make it with this..."_

I know that. I am just writing on this blog because 
 - I want to.
 - I want to build a cool website.
 - I think it'd be fun to record some fun things I learn or see.
 - Maybe I can help someone with one of my posts.

 ## What you will probably see me post.

 At this stage, I am thinking about posting about things I find interesting. I have spent a lot of time doing game development, but I've never released a game??? 
 That doesn't really make a whole lotta sense. I am thinking about making a dev log for Witchpaw which is a game I'm making. It's based on raccoons and magic. Pretty 
 terrible description I know, but that makes you want to read about maybe. I like doing web development so I will post some tutorials or videos on cool components or libraries
 that are worth your time to look at. I get obesssed with games, so I image that I will have some posts about games. I play Marvel Rivals, OldSchool RuneScape, Osu, Minecraft...
 I have a lot of time logged in games, my opinion is not so bad. I watch a lot of anime, I have some heater takes on a lot of great anime, like which ones are worth your time.
