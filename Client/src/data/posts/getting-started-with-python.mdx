# Getting Started wtih Python

So you wanna be the 10x python dev that can solve every Leetcode problem? Well let's get back to reality. There is no guide that can do everything for you, they're' all scams.
The best way to learn python is by writing it, wow shocker. Don't look at the big picture let's just focus on one small step at a time. You want to make a
stock market prediction model that can give you higher returns than half of Congress? Sorry, but this is the wrong place, I wouldn't be here either
if I knew how to do that. I think the best place to start with python is learning to set up an environment to run your code and what is actually going on in the backend.
## Installing Python

Assuming you have Python installed on your computer if you don't go to [Python Installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and click Download
Python 3.12.x (whatever version you want, LTS is best). Follow the intructions there. This will allow you to execute Python code on your system.
You can verify this by opening a terminal window (Press your Windows key and type "cmd" and open the Command Prompt),
then typing
```
python --verison
```
This should respond with something like "Python 3.11.9", any version is fine really.

## Explaining the Python Shell

Once you have Python downlaoded, you are now able to execute python code. Now the fun part is learning, what did you just install? 
Let's start with a shell, a shell is an "interactive environment where users can write, test, and debug Python code in real time." I hate that definition. It's much easier to just
think of it as the place where all the code you write will run from. It's the same idea as when you open Command Prompt or Terminal on Mac. 
The world of computing is vast, but learning a shell is a core principal. 

Then you're gonna hear about a CLI (Command Line Interface), that is also the python shell?! You interface (talk to) the python shell by putting your command on the line you are typing with?
Does that make sense? I type "python --version" into a new line in the command line interface and it tells me what version of python I have. 
The command line is your way of talking to the program, in that case the Windows system. If we want to talk to Python we need to let our windows system direct us to python. 
When we are talking to Win32 in cmd we can type
```
python
```
This lets our windows system knows we want to talk to Python. So it drops us in a "Python Shell" which we can run Python code in. If you are a little more interested in the shell,
command prompt (which you might often hear as Windows CLI (Command Line Interface)) lets you talk to the Windows Operating System which is the "Win32 subsystem" (offical name).
This might be a little out of scope of our project, but it's a really fun and interesting topic to dive into. I would start with learning about bash and maybe look into
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

## Running Commands in the Python Shell

So it's time to write some code. This is the fun part. I've always wanted to write a hello world program, and now it's my time to shine. 
So lets just start with getting Python to print us hello world from the shell. First we start by 
```
python
```
This should put your cursor next to a new line with ">>>" at the start of the line (that's how you can tell it's a python shell).
This will allow you to execute your first command with Python. Python's standard library includes print() which will simply print what you input. So a great first start is to 
decide a phrase like "I enjoy reading" and we can make python respond back by echoing our phrase back. To do this we simply type 
```
print("I enjoy reading")
```
Now you should see "I enjoy reading" spit back at you. How useful right? Well no, the point of this is not to build something useful. An understanding of these concepts is critical to
any aspiring programmer. Once you understand the shell, you undedrstand more than most people to be honest. Most people nowadays just put all this in LLMS (ChatGPT).
If you can understand the underlying concepts here and study them independently, you will have success in programming. This is one of the biggest things I wish I knew before I started 
learning about data structures, algorithms and computer networks. 

My best advice when starting out is to follow this rule: drop the ego and start from the basics, ask the stupid questions while you can because you'll regret not asking.
This isn't even specific to programming, if you apply this rule to any discipline, you will find success and people who will help you.

In the next tutorial we will go over actually creating a script. Which is just a bunch of commands you run all at once. 
As always thanks for reading and take care, hope you found this useful!
