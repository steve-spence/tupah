# Why I Built My Personal Blog from Scratch (and What I Learned)

This is stupid, I'm not keeping up with the changing times. I'm not having AI build my entire project, I actually have to work?
These were all the thoughts I was thinking about when I was starting this project. Now I'm at the stage where I have all the intial project
configuration created and I know how everything in my project both front and back end are working. I built it all and it feels totally amazing!
I think the top 5 things I learned in this project were:

- Tailwind
- Project structure and configurations
- Server and Client side files
- Vercel Hosting
- Google Page Indexing

The first few you might have guessed, but I bet you did not expect the Google Page Indexing. What even is that? When you create a website, link a domain,
and set up your DNS records that's it? Nope. When you try to find your website through google, it won't show up in search results. The Google Search Console is the home
of all websites that live on Google's servers. In order for google's search algorithm to know where to reccomend your site, you need to either map out your site
(with a sitemap) or have Googlebot crawl your site and determine how to index your pages. If all goes well and your site is able to be indexed by the Googlebot, your pages get
added to Google's page index, which is basically a giant database of all known websites. If you are interested and want to read more about this check it out
