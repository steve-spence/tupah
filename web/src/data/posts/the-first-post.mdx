# Welcome

So here I am. Sitting in my room in my last summer of college trying to figuring out what I want to do with my life.

>Why make a blog? It's not like anyone will see this and you won't get recognized or blow up?

I don't really care to be honest. I'm doing this because I want to. I've spent 4 years at college and I feel like the projects I've built are useless. 
I want to build a cool website, record my life, and hopefully help someone learn something. This website is just my way of proving to myself that I'm good enough, and that I can do it.

 ## What you will probably see me post.

 At this stage, I am thinking about posting what I find interesting. My insights into topics I have studied extensivly and spent time learning in and out.
 One of those topics is game development, but I've never released a game. I want to change that. I have an idea for a game called Witchpaw, and I work on it occationally.
 It's based around raccoons that use magic classes, tank mage, damage mage, and heal mage. It would be similar to a Destiny style looter shooter with more emphasis on raids and 
 intense solo play. I hope to have worked on it more at some point, but it's a dream project. I can't image I'll have much to show in the coming months, but if I do it'll be logged at

 If you couldn't tell from the website, I do web development as well. I have so much knowledge in random topics. In my time at college I've done everything from configuring Juniper switches,
 to 3D modeling, AI development, to dropshipping. I lost a lot of time to video games. I spent way too much time playing games and lost track of life. I'm currently trying to move on and get away from it.
 That said, I have a lot of time playing Overwatch 1, Osu, Destiny (1 and 2), Minecraft, and OldSchool RuneScape. If I go back I'll probably play OldSchool, it's my favorite game, ever. 
 Outside of gaming, I've always watched anime, JJK, One Piece, Naruto, Bleach, and so many more. I'm sure I'll be sharing my opinion on new shows and seasons that come out. 
 I always watch a seaonal or two :P

 ## Overall

 This might not be the best blog in the world. I am just looking to document my life. I want to be remembered and if this website helps people remember me, my goal is accomplished. 
 And even if no one ever reads this, I am still proud of the work I did. Tag along for the journey if you are interested, you might just learn a thing or two. Starting this blog at 23!
