When I was first started using tailwind in this project. I was intimidated because it was a new language for me to learn. I had already done projects
using CSS, but none with tailwind. I had built 2 websites using JS, HTML, and CSS and that really helped me grasp tailwind quick. If you are just getting started
in web dev, don't use tailwind. Start a project with JS, HTML, and CSS. The project structure will make way more sense and you will be able to actually learn
what the CSS actually means and how it works behind tailwind. Tailwind is really just shorthand CSS and if you don't know CSS it's not fun to learn tailwind.

Tailwind is great for dark mode. There is a selector dark:bg-[#xxxxxx] and once you set up the toggle for it just kinda works and thats really the best 
complement a dev could recieve. Once you kind of understand how it works, the workflow is a significant imporvement over creating css files in terms of
lines of code. However, I do see that its kind of challenging to keep track of what divs do what. I find myself commenting more because Tailwind goes inside the 
className. More comments are always nice!
